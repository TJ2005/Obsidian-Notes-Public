# 802.11


802.11 is a set of standards for wireless local area network (WLAN) communication established by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). These standards define the protocols for implementing wireless networking in various frequency bands and support different data transmission rates. 

Key points about 802.11 standards include:

1. **Frequency Bands**: 802.11 standards operate primarily in the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequency bands, with newer standards also using the 6 GHz band.
2. **Versions**: Different versions of 802.11 standards include:
   - **802.11a**: Operates in the 5 GHz band, supports up to 54 Mbps.
   - **802.11b**: Operates in the 2.4 GHz band, supports up to 11 Mbps.
   - **802.11g**: Operates in the 2.4 GHz band, supports up to 54 Mbps.
   - **802.11n**: Operates in both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, supports up to 600 Mbps with MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology.
   - **802.11ac**: Operates in the 5 GHz band, supports up to several Gbps with wider channels and more MIMO streams.
   - **802.11ax (Wi-Fi 6)**: Operates in 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, and 6 GHz bands, supports higher data rates, better performance in dense environments, and improved power efficiency.
3. **Security Protocols**: Various security protocols are defined, including WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3.
4. **Range and Throughput**: Different standards have varying ranges and throughput capabilities, with newer standards typically offering higher throughput and better range.

802.11 standards are fundamental to the operation of most modern Wi-Fi networks, enabling wireless connectivity for devices like laptops, smartphones, tablets, and other IoT devices.
