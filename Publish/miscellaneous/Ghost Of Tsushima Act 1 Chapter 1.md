# Ghost Of Tsushima Act 1 Chapter 1


### Beginning 
The game begins by showing the clan flags followed by war horses with [[Samurai]] on them. They have a very good representation of the real world [[Samurai]]s. Their physique depicts their Asian genetics. 

The narrator follows by saying how the Mongol Empire who are very brutal with their fighting style.
"We are 80 [[Samurai]], Fighting against an army. Just to slow the invasion. Today I die for my people."
"There must be thousands of them."
"We will face death and defend our home."
"Tradition
Courage
Honor
They are what make us!
We are warriors of Tsushima
We are [[Samurai]]!!"

In the story the commander is a [[Samurai]] named Lord Shimura he decides to send their best warrior Lord Adachi to the army commanding him to break their spirits.

This implies that he is being sent there to duel with their strongest soldier. If the opponents lose even thousands will stumble and stutter in their actions in war.

It is a smart move but only if the other army honors the duel.

The game has a very beautiful setting of foliage as beautiful as an untouched human land full of grass under the moonlight. Lands full of Chinese silver glass waving in the moonlight as Adachi rides his horse to the army which is set to dock onto the coast.

As Lord Adachi approaches he announces "Send your finest warriors to face me."
A man with big physique approached the men. His armor is different and has more curves almost like Chinese Mongolian armor. He has a bulky glass of supposedly wine which he was drinking.

"I am Harunobu Adachi, Descendant of the legendary Yoshinobu Adachi."

The big man just spills the glass of wine over him. He then receives a torch from a barbarian of his own army. 

He tosses the torch onto the man who's drenched with wine Adachi.
Lord Adachi burns with his well done armor.

As he suffers with the fire he receives another weapon which is a long spear like weapon that looks like a Guando but the bottom end with a sharp three ends like a San Ku Chu ( Chinese dagger ).

He ends his suffering.

The angle he is being shown is a low angle which shows the bon fire in close focus. This depicts him having a dominating nature.

"[[Samurai]]!!"
"Do You Surrender?"

Lord Shimura was Aghast
"Cowards with no honor deserve no mercy!"
"NO MERCY! OPEN FIRE!"
"FOR TSUSHIMA!! CHARGE!"
He commanded as flaming arrows rained down onto the battlefield.

The game now focuses on a character revealing the protagonist. He is riding a horse to battlefield.
Protagonist has an armor set that depicts his [[Samurai]] nature with accents of red. He holds a katana wielding it in such a manner that it doesn't interfere with the horse.

He arrives at the sea coast where the Mongols have already set camp and starts slaying them.
Men fall. But on both sides. It is bound to happen in a war.
The camera shakes a lot because of the impacts of the arrows.
A big barrage of arrows lands beneath the horses path and the horse collapses causing this [[Samurai]] as well to collapse. He loses his [[Samurai]] helmet and his face is revealed with a white headband wore under the helmet. He has also lost his sword.

He makes eye contact with an enemy. Quickly trying to reach for his sword but he is stuck underneath his own horse. As the moment climaxes, Lord Shimura slits the throat of the enemy soldier.

"I Need you with me."
"We've Lost so many..."
"We have to keep pushing Lord [[Sakai]]. Even if it costs us our lives."

They keep walking over corpse ridden terrain of the coast reaching a valley like structure where they find more of their men. They also find more Mongols. They fight yet again. This time a lot of [[Samurai]]s lose their lives to the battle.

Only Shimura and [[Sakai]] are left.

"There is only one path we must take. Fight the Mongol Leader and take his life!"
"Ill fight with you till the end."

They find the Mongol leader and charge towards them. Another exploding arrow lands below [[Sakai]] leading the protagonist to collapse. 

He wakes up to the grunts of his uncle being captured by the Mongols. Where he finds his sword trying to grab it he walks only to reveal 2 arrows on his back and the third one impaling him to collapse him.

A man approaches to the restrained Lord shimura.
He bows and says
"I am [[Kotun Khan|Kotun]], Cousin of Kublai Grandson of [[Genghis Khan | Genghis]]. Brother, You are a warrior. I can see that. You trained your whole Life for this and you have Won battles... that lesser men have called unwinnable, yes?"
He grabs Shimura's Sword. Its a katana.
"But while you were sharpening your sword... do you know how I prepared today? I know your language... your traditions, Your Beliefs, which villages to tame and which to burn. So I'll ask you once again [[Samurai]]"
"Will you surrender?"

Lord Shimura just keeps looking into his eyes meaning rejection.
To which [[Kotun Khan|Kotun]] reacts with him slashing Shimura.



[[Sakai]] Clenches his fist.


### Post Mongol Entrance

[[Sakai]] is on a small hill where no one can spot him he is near a bon fire and a little bucket of water where he implies that someone worked hard to keep him alive.
He has been stripped from all of his armor and weapons. 

The hills give him a view of the Mongol ridden village.
He then squeezes through and finds way. He realizes that someone saved him and they must have his armor and sword. 
He sneaks through the Mongol Army and then finds some supplies.
He sees that someone was sharpening their blade on a whetstone.
He also finds his armor which is broken. But he still puts it on as it is better than nothing. 
Next he opens the door showing no signs of stealth.
Then a woman comes who asks him to stop and get inside quick and hide.
A big soldier comes inside and asks the woman for rice.
She starts wailing and says that please don't kill me. I have some rice. To which the soldier slams her onto the bamboo mat floor. She keeps wailing as the man crouches to open the pot of rice. 
She keeps wailing and crying as she approaches the man and then slits his throat with a Kukri Knife.

"Who are you?"
"I am [[Yuna]]. You want your sword? follow me"
"How long was I blacked out?"
"Long enough for the Mongols to conquer half the island."

Then they start sneaking their way hiding from the Mongol soldiers.
The Mongols are killing the citizens that are not complying to which [[Sakai]] reacts very angered.
But [[Yuna]] suggests that we cannot help them as its too late now.
He then asks about what is Lord Shimura's condition?
To which she says forget him.
He then confesses that he is Lod Shimura's Nephew.
She realizes that he is [[Sakai Jin|Jin]] the Jito's nephew.
"I have to know did he survive?"
"I think so he was taken as an prisoner Towards east"
"Then it must be castle Kaneda where they must be celebrating victory. I will go there and free him"
"I Didn't nurse you back to health to watch you throw your life away."
"Why did you save me?"
"I Couldn't leave you to die. I need some help."
"Lord Shimura can help the whole island. And he's the only family I have left"
Mongol Patrols shouting
"Lets move"

Then the crawl under a hut where they have to witness a villager being butchered.
They see rider soldiers on horse armed for battle.

When they reach the road they realize that the terrain is no longer similar and now they have to find a new way as it has been cleared. 
[[Sakai Jin|Jin]] Suggests he will lure them towards him.
But [[Yuna]] ideates to use the cart to cover themselves to cross the road.

The village is filled with Mongols so they take the roofs as per [[Yuna]]'s Suggestion.

"You climb roofs, Scavenge battlefields.... You're a thief." [Vagabond]
"When I need something I take it."
"I Traded it for food and medicine your Katana."
They then infiltrate a house where they take the supplies they would need for their journey.
[[Sakai Jin|Jin]] says "This is someone's house we cant do this..."
[[Yuna]] replies "They are not coming back."
They then traverse to the traders hut.

"Toru?! Shit. The bastards found him and killed him."
"Stay and watch, I will search the house. They will answer for this"
"Maybe Your katana is inside hidden?"
He then finds his katana insides his house.
He unsheathes the sword and then there is a flashback

### The Flashback (Tutorial)

Sakai [[Sakai Jin|Jin]] is a child in this scene.
He in a ring which is partially sheltered by a maple tree. The ring is full of red maple leaves making the ring look beautiful and it composites well with the lake that right besides.

He is using the Sakai Katana to practice.
"I am [[Sakai Jin|Jin]] Sakai"
"Nephew to the great Lord Shimura"

Shimura enters the scene as he watches upon his nephew.
He chuckles "Your enemy is no match for you."
"But you lack control"
"I was Practicing"
"With your fathers weapon?"
[[Sakai Jin|Jin]] Bowed down and handed the sword to him
Shimura Says "The sword of Clan Sakai... Has saved lives and ended wars"

As he looks upon [[Sakai Jin|Jin]] Sakai while the rustling leaves fall and float in the air he observes that he has some bruises.
He realizes he is hurt
"I will teach you to defend yourself"
"I Know how to fight!"
"To master the blade, You must first control your emotions"
Then he replies in a calm manner
"I can do that uncle"
"Show me"

[[weaponry]] [[katana]]
Heavy attacks are filled with force but are slow.
The light attacks are swift but not much damaging.

"With force like that you must not have got bruised so easily."
"It was not a fair fight"
"Imagine it was an unfair fight he comes back to finish what he started what will you do then?"
"He's Big, I'm Quicker. I'll wait for him to lose his strength and strike when he is out of stamina."
Shimura acknowledges and says "Good... A Warrior must have patience to bring down good opponents. Now!! Show me your strength and break through my defenses."


Multiple Heavy Attacks breaks the guard.

"Enough! I yield"
"You held back!!"
"I did not"
"You Lie..."
"I Do not lie"
"Really?"
"If you had a real sword I would be dead by this moment. Now I will strike and you try to block the strikes."

Blocking in this game is not like a regular sword blocking in most entertainment shows.
It can be seen that it is realistic.
A block that uses too much force to clash back will chip thy sword quicker. [[Dune]]
Instead you block and guide the sharpness towards void where your body doesn't Lie.

"Im sorry can we take a break?"
"No We are not done yet use your resolve and fight through the pain"
A [[Samurai]]s resolve is very strong.
in this game the resolve is gained by making proper hits and finishing opponents.
This resolve can be used to heal later.
There is parrying in the game as well.

"Good [[Sakai Jin|Jin]]! You are improving..."
"Out of breathe?"
"It will take more than a child to beat me. Now then lets see how u defend against a spear"

[[weaponry]]
A spear is so well represented in the game. Its a pointed long weapon and has a lot of reach in one axis and that Axis is where it is thrusted. A spear has long range, A lot of damage as momentum can be increased, However it can be countered by just moving out of the axis of its thrust. This requires a good observation and reaction time and if not done properly can kill.
With enough practice one can master defeating a spear easily even with fists.
By just thrusting yourself towards right or left u can then close in on to the wielder of the spear to knock him down as the sphere doesn't have any inward range.

In the game he dodges to the right or left and immediately slashes with his bokken.

"You see there is no weapon - no warrior that you cannot overcome"
"Thank you for your lessons uncle"
"We are not done yet [[[[Sakai Jin|Jin]] sakai]] would you spar with me"
"I don't want to hurt you uncle"
"Or let me rephrase it the one who wins chooses dinner"

[[Sakai Jin|Jin]] Sakai wins as the player has to control him

"Before we eat, I have one last question. For generations our families have lived by a code. Tell me the virtues that guide us."
"Loyalty to our lord, Control of our emotions and..."
"You know this."
"Honor. To fight bravely and uphold the legacy of Clan [[Sakai]]"
"Those were your fathers word what does honor mean to you?"
"I guess... Protecting people those who cannot protect themselves"
"You have a good heart. But first we must show everyone that we serve our lord with integrity, [[courage]], [[self control]]"
"You say it like that's easy."
"It's never easy [[Sakai Jin|Jin]]. I struggle with it everyday. But we must set an example for our people. By remaining true to our code. And to ourselves." [[indomitable human spirit]]

As [[Sakai Jin|Jin]] raises his wooden bokken it fades into the grownup [[Sakai Jin|Jin]] who just found his [[Sakai]] Katana back. He raises the katana over his head declaring to the intruder who found him that he will face him. A dominating [[sangen]] tune plays as he unsheathes the sword and takes the form of [[stone stance]].


### Horse 

"Good you found your sword" says [[[[Yuna]]]] as she saw [[Sakai Jin|Jin]] slash the spear wielder.
"Where can I find a horse?"
"This way"
They get out of the hut and start following [[[[Yuna]]]]'s Lead. [[Sakai Jin|Jin]] realizes that there are a lot of mongol riders.
"We can get close, Slit their throats and kill them without a sound" suggested [[[[Yuna]]]] when she saw the amount of Mongol Soldier.
[[Sakai Jin|Jin]] was not fond of his idea as it is not an tactic that aligns with his code and honor.
"Without Honor? I will not break my code. Face me Invader!"
Then [[Sakai Jin|Jin]] slashes 3 Soldiers and gets through into the gate where they find more guards.
"Dont let anyone escape" as [[Sakai Jin|Jin]] slashed four more guards saving an old man who had a young infant.
"Thank you My Lord. I thought no [[Samurai]] is left..."
"Do you have somewhere safe to go?"
"Yes"
"Then go there and guard your son with your life."
The person who he saved proceeds to leave.

"You risked your life for them." Said [[[[Yuna]]]]
"They can't defend themselves. And I... Can't let more of our people die."
"They're not the only ones who u can save. My brother the [[Mongols]] took him"
"Thats why you saved me."
"Taka is my only family"
"and Lord Shimura is mine."
"Please I want to find him."
"I Will help you find him after I save lord Shimura."

Then he slashes a few more guards and finds [[Samurai]] Horses.
Here he names the horse ( There are three options Nobu, Sora, Kage) Sora.
Then they ride to castle Kaneda.

"Castle Kaneda..." says [[Sakai Jin|Jin]].
"They are holding your uncle inside.
We can cause a distraction and Sneak In."
"No I will go through the front gate and straight in. [[Kotun Khan]] set fire to our Best swordsman humiliated my uncle and butchered the warriors of Tsushima"
"You are repeating the same mistakes that your comrades made!"
"Wait here until I finish them"

"I've come for Lord Shimura!"
As he suggests a [[standoff]]
the standoff in this game is a mechanic that allows you to fight a group of strong people by first slaying the strongest of the group. Its like a shootout in the west. The one who slashes effectively wins. In the game [[Sakai Jin|Jin]] is always patient and waits for him to unsheathe his sword as he would immediately slit the throat of the opponent upon the slight suggestion of an attack. However the opponent can also feint causing him leave himself open if not done properly. This is an entertaining method of letting the players kill.
