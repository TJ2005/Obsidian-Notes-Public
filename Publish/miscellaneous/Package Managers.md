# Package Managers

# Main note

### Installing Packages
To install packages on a Debian-based system like Ubuntu, you can use the `apt-get` command with `sudo` to gain administrative privileges. The general syntax is:

```bash
sudo apt-get install package_name
```

For example, to install the `curl` package, you would use:

```bash
sudo apt-get install curl
```
