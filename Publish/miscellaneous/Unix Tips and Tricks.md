# Unix Tips and Tricks

# Main note

## **Creating Aliases**
Aliases are command shortcuts. If u find your self executing the same command again and again then you should try setting an alias for that command.
Here's the syntax
```bash
$ Alias command_trigger="command that u want to run on trigger"
```

#### Making Alias Set Forever
This is basic command but this will not be saved so to save it we need to modify the bashrc File 
```shell
$ sudo nano ~/.bashhrc
```
With this u can edit the bashrc file
In the bottom add the same command that u added at the syntax point. 
With this your alias will be ready to be triggered at any point!
