### Making Index
**Prompt:**

Please create an index for the provided note using the format `[[#Title#Heading#Subheading]]`. In this format:
- `Title` is the main subject of the note.
- `Heading` represents primary sections.
- `Subheading` includes any subsections or detailed points.

In the index:
- Include all titles and subheadings as examples.
- Exclude the "References" and "Information" sections from the index.

**Example:**

Given the following note:

```
# Solar Energy
Solar energy is harnessed from the sun and converted into electricity or heat.

#### Introduction
Solar energy has become a significant topic in renewable energy sources due to its sustainability and environmental benefits.

#### Types of Solar Energy Systems
There are several types of solar energy systems:
- **Photovoltaic Systems**: Convert sunlight directly into electricity.
- **Solar Thermal Systems**: Use sunlight to heat fluids, which then produce steam to drive a turbine.

#### Benefits of Solar Energy
- **Environmental Impact**: Reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
- **Cost Savings**: Decreases electricity bills over time.

#### Challenges and Considerations
- **Initial Costs**: High upfront costs for installation.
- **Weather Dependency**: Efficiency can be affected by weather conditions.

**The index should be:**

- [Solar Energy](#solar-energy)
  - [Introduction](#introduction)
  - [Types of Solar Energy Systems](#types-of-solar-energy-systems)
    - [Photovoltaic Systems](#photovoltaic-systems)
    - [Solar Thermal Systems](#solar-thermal-systems)
  - [Benefits of Solar Energy](#benefits-of-solar-energy)
  - [Challenges and Considerations](#challenges-and-considerations)

Use this format to create the index for your note, including all titles and subheadings.

### Making Index for Cross embed

**Prompt:**

Please format the provided text by creating headings and subheadings in the style `[[#Title#Heading#Subheading]]`. Each section or subsection should be converted into this format. 

For instance, given a text that includes:

```
# topic

This section introduces the topic and its relevance.

#### Overview
Here we discuss the general aspects of the topic.

#### Details
This section provides a deeper dive into the specifics.

#### Examples
Examples illustrating key points are included here.

#### Additional Information
Any supplementary details or references related to the topic.
```

Please format it as:

```
![[topic#topic#Introduction]]
![[topic#topic#Overview]]
![[topic#topic#Details]]
![[topic#topic#Examples]]
![[topic#topic#Additional Information]]
```

The `Title` should be the main title or subject of the document, the `Heading` should be the primary sections, and the `Subheading` should reflect any subsections or detailed points under each heading.

# Latex
For Obsidian 
always inline latex starts with $and ends with $ do not add space between Dont use ` or dont use \[ or \] as well
Similarly for centered latex use $$Latex$$


Please use inline LaTeX formulas within `$` for inline math expressions and `$$` for centered or block-level math in markdown when writing for Obsidian.

Please use inline LaTeX formulas within `$` for inline math expressions and `$$` for centered or block-level math in markdown when writing for Obsidian. Avoid using `\(`, `\)`, `\[`, or `\]` for math expressions, as these can cause issues with rendering in Obsidian by being treated as simple brackets rather than LaTeX delimiters. This results in improper display or ignored content. Using `$` for inline math and `$$` for block math ensures correct rendering in Obsidian.
