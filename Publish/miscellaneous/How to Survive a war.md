# How to Survive a war

## Micro Terrain.
Even an inch of dirt or two can be used to go prone and save a lot of [[bullets]] flying by.

## Explosives.
[[Explosives]] often explode in a manner to attack the person standing upright in the range to get damaged by the shrapnel. Thus making going prone an advantage against shrapnels based explosives.

## Sound Indications.
Indicators like sound often help to understand the current area situations. One should know when the enemies are retreating and when they are moving forward.

## Drones.
[[Drones]] are often movement based. They drop [[grenades]] near you. [[Kevlar]] will be an important factor to survive from drone grenades.
Drones are working on signals and sometimes are operated by an operator. Thus making a [[signal jammer]] highly effective. This will be the future of combat against drone.

## Make Doors for bunkers.
#### Heres why:
- The door often deflects the explosives dropped by drones.
- They secure yourself from any shrapnel damage and also toss the grenade away from the shelter.

## [[Mines]]:
Murphy's survival laws states that the easiest way and path has already been mined.
There are lot of mines. Anti personnel, Anti Tank, etc. There are systems like anti mine systems, a removal vehicle and much more.

## Take the path of most resistance:
The ambushes, mines are often not laid out through this way.
Mark Mines. and give information to everyone else.

## Air Craft
- #### Fixed Wing
- #### Rotary
- #### Helicopter
Stay Away from areas that are valuable when airborne enemy vehicles are in the range.
[[Camouflage]] vehicles and equipment.
Avoid roof.

## [[Missiles]]
Littering or any other signs of living gets bombed easily.

## [[Tanks]] and BMPS
Missiles destroy tanks. [[Javelin]] is an anti tank weapon. 
## Don't be observed
Being observed is intel for enemy.

## Complacency

## Faraday Bags
They are bags that absolutely block every form of radiation from the device.
