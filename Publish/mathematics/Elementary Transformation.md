Elementary Transformation

Any one of the following operations on a matrix is called an elementary transformation.
1. Interchange of any two rows (or columns), denoted by $R_i \leftrightarrow R_j$; or $C_i \leftrightarrow C_j$;
2. Multiplication of the elements of any row (or column) by any non-zero number $k$ and denoted by $R_i \rightarrow kR_i$; or $C_i \rightarrow kC_i$;
3. Addition of a constant multiple of the elements of any row to the corresponding element of any other row, denoted by $R_i \rightarrow R_i + kR_j$; or $C_i \rightarrow C_i + kC_j$;
