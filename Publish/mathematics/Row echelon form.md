# Row echelon form

#### Echelon form of a matrix

A matrix A is said to be in echelon form if the following hold:
i. Every row of a matrix A which has all its entries zero occurs below every row which has a non-zero entry.
ii. The number of zeros preceding the first non-zero element in a row is less than the number of such zeros in the succeeding rows. Example A = $$ \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 0 \\ 0 & 3 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 5 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} $$

Note:
- A given matrix A is in echelon form if one or more elements in each of the first r rows are non-zero, and these first r rows form an upper triangular matrix. The elements in the remaining rows are zero.
- To reduce the matrix to echelon form, only row transformations are to be applied.
