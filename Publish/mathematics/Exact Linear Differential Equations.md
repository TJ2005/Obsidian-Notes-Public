# Exact Linear Differential Equations
#### Definition :
Differential equations are often in the form of 

$$
M(x,y)dx~+~N(x,y)dy=0
$$
Two Variables For one variable refer [[Basic Undergraduate Differential Equations]]

If this Differential Equation is **Exact** only if there is a function of two variables
$$u(x,y)~~~~~~ such ~that~~~~~~~d(u)=Mdx+Ndy$$

Where $u(x,y)=C$  where C is the arbitrary constant

---
#### Condition for differential equation to be [[exact]] : 

The differential equation $$M(x,y)dx~+~N(x,y)dy=0$$
Where $M$ And $N$ are functions of $x$ and $y$
Will be [[Exact Differential Equation|**Exact** differential equation]]
When 
$$ \frac{\partial M}{\partial y}=\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}$$

And the solution will be given by
$$\int_{\mathrm{\scriptsize{y~constant}}}M d x+\int{\big(}\mathrm{terms~of~N~free}\,\mathrm{from}\;x{\big)}d y=c$$
