# Equations Reducible to exact equations

Sometimes the differential equation which is not exact, can be made so on multiplication by a suitable factor is called integrating factor. The rules for finding integrating factors of the differential equation are as follows:
$${\mathrm{Solve~}}\left(x^{2}+y^{2}+2x\right)d x+2y d y=0\,.\;(\mathrm{ans};\cdot\left(\right)\,)$$

### Methods

Here P is the function obtained ( of x or y)

- If $\frac{\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}\!-\!\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}}{N}=$ function of $x$ then  $e^{\int P d x}$  is the integrating factor
- If $\frac{{\frac{\partial N}{\partial x}}-{\frac{\partial M}{\partial y}}}{M}=$ function of $y$ then  $e^{\int P d y}$  is the integrating factor
- If the equation is in the form of  $f_{1}\left(x y\right)y d x+f_{2}\left(x y\right)x d y=0$  Then
	integrating factor is $\frac{1}{Mx-Ny}$
- If the Differential Equation is Homogeneous Equation 
	then its Integrating factor is $\frac{1}{M x+N y}$
