# Rank of matrix


Let A be a non-zero matrix. A positive integer r is called the rank of the matrix A if

- Every minor of order greater than r is zero.
- There exists at least one minor of order r which is non-zero, and

the rank of matrix A is denoted by œÅ(A). The rank in echelon form is equal to the number of non-zero rows of the matrix.

Methods to find (determine) the rank of a matrix:
1. [[Minor method to find rank| Minor (Determinant) form]]
