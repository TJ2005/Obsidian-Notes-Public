# Subspace of Vector Space


1.3.2 **Subspace of Vector Space**: If $(V)$ is a vector space and $(W)$ is any non-empty subset of $(V)$, then $(W)$ is called a subspace of $(V)$ if $(W)$ itself is a vector space over the field $(R)$ under the same vector addition and scalar multiplication as vector space $(V)$.

Let $(V)$ be a vector space over $(R).$ A non-empty subset $(W)$ of $(V)$ is a subspace of $(V)$ if:

1. $(W \subseteq V)$
2. $(W)$ satisfies the following conditions:
    - **Closure under vector addition:** For any $(u, v \in W), (u + v \in W).$
    - **Closure under scalar multiplication:** For any $(a \in R) and (u \in W), (au \in W)$.

Alternatively, a subset (W) of a vector space is called a subspace if$$ (au + bv \in W)\ \  for \ all\ \  (u, v \in W)\ \ and \ \ (a, b \in R).
$$
Note that for a subset to become a subspace, it is necessary that it must contain the zero vector.

For example, the set of complex numbers $(\mathbb{C})$ is a vector space over $(\mathbb{R})$, and $(\mathbb{R})$ (the set of all real numbers) is its proper subset. Thus,$(\mathbb{R})$ is a subspace of $(\mathbb{C})$ over $(\mathbb{R})$.
