# System of linear equations in matrix

Definitions, Formulae and Theory
A linear system of m equations in n unknowns $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$  is a set of equations of the form:
$a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + ... + a_{1n}x_n = b_1$
$a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2 + ... + a_{2n}x_n = b_2$
$...$ \
$a_{m1}x_1 + a_{m2}x_2 + ... + a_{mn}x_n = b_m$


This is called a System of [[Linear Equations]]. It is called "[[linear]]" because each variable $x_i$ is of first degree only.

The given system can also be written in matrix form as:
$[ A ] [ X ] = [ B ]$


where:
- A is the matrix of [[coefficients]]
- X is the matrix of unknown variables
- B is the matrix of [[constants]]

If B = 0, then the system is [[homogeneous]]. If B â‰  0, then the system is [[non-homogeneous]].

The values of unknowns form a solution set of the given system, satisfying all the equations.
