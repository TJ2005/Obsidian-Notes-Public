# Integration By Parts

Formula goes by:

$$\int u\;v\;d x=u\int v\;d x-\int\left({\frac{d u}{d x}}\int v\;d x\right)d x$$
Note:
• [[Integration]] by parts is not applicable for functions such as J Nix sin x dx.
• We do not add any constant while finding the integral of the second function.
• Usually, if any function is a power of x or a [[polynomial]] in x, then we take it as the first
function. However, in cases where another function is an inverse trigonometric function or
logarithmic function, then we take them as first function.
