	Let's calculate the shortest path from **node A** to all other nodes using **Dijkstra's Algorithm** based on the diagram provided. Here are the edges and costs:

1. **A → B** with cost 3
2. **A → C** with cost 2
3. **A → D** with cost 5
4. **B → D** with cost 1
5. **B → E** with cost 4
6. **C → F** with cost 1
7. **D → F** with cost 3
8. **E → F** with cost 2

### **Step-by-Step Process of Dijkstra's Algorithm**:

#### **Initial Setup:**

- Start at node **A** (source node), with an initial distance of **0** for **A** and infinity (`∞`) for all other nodes.
- A table of distances and previous nodes:

| Node | Distance | Previous |
|------|----------|----------|
| A    | 0        | -        |
| B    | ∞        | -        |
| C    | ∞        | -        |
| D    | ∞        | -        |
| E    | ∞        | -        |
| F    | ∞        | -        |

---

### **Step 1: Process Node A**

- From **A**:
  - **A → B**: Distance to **B** = 0 + 3 = **3**.
  - **A → C**: Distance to **C** = 0 + 2 = **2**.
  - **A → D**: Distance to **D** = 0 + 5 = **5**.

Update the table:

| Node | Distance | Previous |
|------|----------|----------|
| A    | 0        | -        |
| B    | 3        | A        |
| C    | 2        | A        |
| D    | 5        | A        |
| E    | ∞        | -        |
| F    | ∞        | -        |

Choose the node with the smallest distance, which is **C** (distance = 2).

---

### **Step 2: Process Node C**

- From **C**:
  - **C → F**: Distance to **F** = 2 + 1 = **3**.

Update the table:

| Node | Distance | Previous |
|------|----------|----------|
| A    | 0        | -        |
| B    | 3        | A        |
| C    | 2        | A        |
| D    | 5        | A        |
| E    | ∞        | -        |
| F    | 3        | C        |

Now, choose the node with the smallest distance, which is either **B** or **F** (both have a distance of 3). Let's process **B**.

---

### **Step 3: Process Node B**

- From **B**:
  - **B → D**: Distance to **D** = 3 + 1 = **4** (this is better than the previous distance of 5, so we update it).
  - **B → E**: Distance to **E** = 3 + 4 = **7**.

Update the table:

| Node | Distance | Previous |
|------|----------|----------|
| A    | 0        | -        |
| B    | 3        | A        |
| C    | 2        | A        |
| D    | 4        | B        |
| E    | 7        | B        |
| F    | 3        | C        |

Next, choose the node with the smallest distance, which is **F** (distance = 3).

---

### **Step 4: Process Node F**

- From **F**:
  - **F → D**: Distance to **D** = 3 + 3 = **6**, but the current distance to **D** is 4, so no update is needed.
  - **F → E**: Distance to **E** = 3 + 2 = **5** (this is better than the previous distance of 7, so we update it).

Update the table:

| Node | Distance | Previous |
|------|----------|----------|
| A    | 0        | -        |
| B    | 3        | A        |
| C    | 2        | A        |
| D    | 4        | B        |
| E    | 5        | F        |
| F    | 3        | C        |

Now, choose the node with the smallest distance, which is **D** (distance = 4).

---

### **Step 5: Process Node D**

- **D** has no neighbors that can provide a shorter path to other nodes, so no updates are needed.

Next, process **E** (distance = 5), but there are no further updates necessary.

---

### **Final Shortest Paths from A**:

| Node | Distance from A | Previous Node |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| A    | 0               | -             |
| B    | 3               | A             |
| C    | 2               | A             |
| D    | 4               | B             |
| E    | 5               | F             |
| F    | 3               | C             |

---

### **Conclusion:**
- The shortest path from **A → B** is 3 (A → B).
- The shortest path from **A → C** is 2 (A → C).
- The shortest path from **A → D** is 4 (A → B → D).
- The shortest path from **A → E** is 5 (A → C → F → E).
- The shortest path from **A → F** is 3 (A → C → F).
