# CompTIA Introduction

## Prerequisites software
Hereâ€™s the list along with a brief explanation of what each item will be used for:

1. **Operating Systems:**
   - **Windows 10 Professional (64-bit), Education (64-bit), or Home (64-bit)**: The primary OS for running software and virtual machines. Windows 10 Pro is preferred for using Hyper-V and advanced networking tools.
   - **Linux OS (Ubuntu Desktop, Ubuntu Server, Kali Linux)**: Used for running projects that require different OS environments, server configurations, or penetration testing (Kali Linux).

2. **Web Browsers:**
   - **Chrome, Firefox, Edge**: For accessing web resources, AWS, and downloading tools.

3. **Virtualization Software (Hypervisor):**
   - **Oracle VirtualBox**: A free and widely-used tool for creating virtual machines to run multiple OS environments on a single machine.
   - **Client Hyper-V**: Virtualization tool included in Windows 10 Pro and Education for creating VMs.
   - **VMware Workstation Player**: Another virtual machine tool, especially for running different operating systems side by side.

4. **Cloud Services:**
   - **AWS Educate**: Provides cloud resources and free credits for students and instructors, used for cloud-based projects, network simulations, and virtual machines.

5. **Software Tools:**
   - **LastPass**: Password manager for securely managing credentials.
   - **Cisco Packet Tracer**: A network simulation tool for practicing networking configurations and setups.
   - **Wireshark**: A network protocol analyzer used for monitoring and capturing network traffic for analysis.
   - **ZenMap/Nmap**: Network scanning tools used for security auditing and discovering hosts and services on a network.
   - **IP Scanner**: Tool for scanning and identifying devices connected to the network.
   - **PuTTY**: SSH and Telnet client used for remote access to servers and networking equipment.
   - **TotuSoft LAN Speed Test**: Used for testing the speed and performance of your local area network.
   - **TamoSoft Throughput Test**: Measures the bandwidth performance of a network.
   - **iPerf**: A network testing tool to measure the bandwidth between two points.
   - **PRTG Network Monitor**: Network monitoring software to track the performance of your network.
   - **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**: Allows you to run a Linux environment on your Windows machine for various development and networking tasks.
   - **Advanced Port Scanner**: Scans open ports on a network, useful for diagnosing network security and configurations.
   - **Wi-Fi Analyzer (smartphone app)**: Used for analyzing and optimizing wireless networks.
   - **THC-IPv6 (Kali Linux VM)**: Tool for testing IPv6 security features and penetration testing exercises.

Each of these tools plays a critical role in building practical networking skills, from setting up virtual environments to analyzing and troubleshooting networks.

## What is a network?
A network is a group of computers and other devices that are connected by Some Type of Transmission Media. The network can be comprised any possible combination of all these devices.

The smallest network is a a connection of two computers connected by a cable in a home office. The biggest would be the internet connected via various means with each other.

Networks can be connected with any possible connection like copper, fiber-optics, radio waves. Devices that are connected can be anything from smart phones, Computers, vehicles, ANYTHING!
