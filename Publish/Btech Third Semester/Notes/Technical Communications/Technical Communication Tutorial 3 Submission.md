# Technical Communication Tutorial 3 Submission

# Main note

### Question
We find a wallet full of money. The question arises whether we keep it or we submit it to the police. This is a question of ethical perspective.

### Research
What defines a good research, is it
- Representation
- Validity
- Content richness
or does it has to be ethical as well?
The answer seems to be the latter.

### Ethics
- Defined by people who follow a set of rules in unisons or promoted to follow
	- Ideal Human Character
	- Behavior
	- Conduct
###### Examples of Unethical Practices

##### IRB
Follows the Belmont Report 1974
1. Respect for persons
2. Beneficence
3. Justice
By putting this to application they get
1. Considers informed consent.
2. Evaluates risks vs benefits
3. judges that the selection of participation is fair.
4. Unethical Research can happen in any discipline.
##### Consequences of not following Ethics
###### Piltdown Man (1910-1912 CE)
- **Issue:** The discovery of Piltdown Man delayed the progress of finding ancient human ancestors due to misidentification.

  - **Mistaken Identity:** The species was falsely identified, misleading scientific understanding.
  - **Impact:** Delayed accurate research and hindered scientific progress.

###### The Tuskegee Experiment (1932-1972 CE)
- **Issue:** Black men were subjected to experiments without their consent, leading to unnecessary suffering and death.
- **Ethical Concerns:** 
  - **Lack of Consent:** Participants were not informed about the nature of the study or their right to withdraw.
  - **Harm:** The study inflicted physical and emotional harm, with lasting negative consequences for participants.

###### Monster Study (1939 CE)
- **Issue:** 22 orphan children were subjected to either positive speech therapy or negative belittlement to study speech development.
- **Ethical Concerns:** 
  - **Injustice:** Children were manipulated without their consent, causing psychological harm.
  - **Harm:** Negative belittlement led to long-term emotional damage.

###### Conclusion
Ethical adherence in research is crucial for maintaining public trust, ensuring justice, and preventing harm. Ethical violations undermine the integrity of scientific research and have long-lasting negative impacts on individuals and society.
