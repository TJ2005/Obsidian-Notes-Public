# Summary

Proof of Ethical Conduct's existence is said to be since the birth of human documentation.  A key aspect of a document has been to be ethical. By maintaining ethics in a document one must check if they are not harming others by Plagiarism or Cheating. This may result in the document to be less credible. An important reason people embrace Ethics is to avoid losing funding for their research paper, Loss of jobs, Losing relevance. An honest research paper would result in better response overall. To combat such practices we have seen Ethical Conduct Codes such as IRB which fights for respect, beneficence, justice. By putting this conduct to application the documenting community have benefited from benefits like Informed Consent before using someone else's research paper for reference. There are various other aspects on how people benefit from this. We have seen consequences of not following ethics. For example the Monster Study (1939 CE) where children subjected to positive therapy or negative belittlement to study speech development. Which resulted in kids having a long term emotional damage.In conclusion Ethical adherence in research is crucial for maintaining public trust, ensuring justice, and preventing harm.
