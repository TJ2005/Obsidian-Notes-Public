## Questions & Answers

1. What is a computer network? (5m)
	- It is a collection of autonomous computer devices interconnected by a single technology.
	- [[TCP]]/[[IP]]
	- Interconnection can happen in variety of places such as
		- Broadcast
		- Point to Point
	- A link is established using various methods such as Wired connection ( RJ45 ), WiFi 2.4Ghz or WiFi 5ghz The technologies actual name is [[802.11]] , Hub, Switches, Fibernet, [[Sonet]], ATM ( [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] )
