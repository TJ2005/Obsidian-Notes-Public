# Computer Networks Lecture 9

Difference between OSI and TCP/IP Layer

| OSI                                                              | TCP IP                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| 7 Layers                                                         | 5 Layers                 |
| PDU Unit Protocol Data Unit                                      | Segment                  |
| There is no port number, IP address <br>Socket, Physical Address | Socket, Port, IP Address |
| Single Transport                                                 | UDP TCP Protocol         |
| Less Security                                                    | IPSEC, HTTPS             |
Network Byte Order
Little Big Endian
Functions related for Conversion
1) HTONL unsigned Long Integer to network Byte Order
2) HTONS Unsigned Short to NBO S = Short 16 bit
3) HTHL an unsigned Network Byte Order Long Integer to Host Byte Order L = Long bit 32 Bit
4) NTOHS An Unsigned short NBO to host byte order
