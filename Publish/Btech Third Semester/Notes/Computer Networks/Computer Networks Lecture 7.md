### Services Provided
1. Framing
2. Error Control

4. Physical Adressing
5. Access Control

### Flow Control
1) Co ordinates the amount of data that can before receiving an acknowledgement
2) Speed Matching process mechanism
3) Flow control is a procedures that tells the sender how much data it can transmit before it must wait for an acknowledgement from the receiver
