## Content

### Determining the Parity of the Signal

#### Even Signal
The even part of a signal \( x(t) \), denoted as \( X_e(t) \), is given by:
$$ X_e(t) = \frac{1}{2} [x(t) + x(-t)] $$

#### Odd Signal
The odd part of a signal \( x(t) \), denoted as \( X_o(t) \), is given by:
$$ X_o(t) = \frac{1}{2} [x(t) - x(-t)] $$

In exams, they can ask a reverse engineering type question where they provide two signals and they ask us to determine which is even and which is odd.
