## Introduction

### What is MATLAB
MATLAB is a high-level programming language and interactive environment used for numerical computation, visualization, and programming. It is widely used in academia and industry for various applications, including signal processing, image processing, control systems, and more.

### Why MATLAB
MATLAB is chosen for its powerful computational capabilities, extensive libraries, and ease of use for matrix operations, plotting, and algorithm development. It supports various toolboxes that extend its functionality to specific domains.

## Basic MATLAB Commands

### clc
The `clc` command in MATLAB is used to clear the Command Window, removing all previous outputs and providing a clean workspace for new commands.

### clear all
The `clear all` command removes all variables, functions, and MEX-files from the workspace, freeing up system memory.

### Variable Assignment
In MATLAB, variables are assigned using the equals sign (`=`). For example, `x = 5` assigns the value 5 to the variable `x`.

### subplot
The `subplot` function is used to create a grid of subplots within a single figure. The syntax `subplot(m, n, p)` divides the figure into an `m`-by-`n` grid and places the plot in the `p`-th position.

### plot
The `plot` function is used to create two-dimensional line plots. For example, `plot(t, x)` plots the variable `x` against `t`.

### Labels and Titles

#### xlabel
The `xlabel('text')` function sets the label for the x-axis of the plot.

#### ylabel
The `ylabel('text')` function sets the label for the y-axis of the plot.

#### title
The `title('text')` function sets the title of the plot.

## Signals

### Exponential Signal
An exponential signal in MATLAB can be generated using the `exp` function. For example, `x = exp(t)` creates an exponential signal.

### Unit Step
A unit step signal can be created using the `heaviside` function. For example, `x = heaviside(t)` creates a unit step signal.

### Unit Ramp
A unit ramp signal can be generated by defining it piecewise. For example, `x = t .* (t >= 0)` creates a unit ramp signal.


```matlab
clc;
clear all;
close all;
t=[-1:01:10];
n=length(t);
u=[];
								for i=1:n
	if(t(i)<0)
		u(i)=0;
	else:
```
