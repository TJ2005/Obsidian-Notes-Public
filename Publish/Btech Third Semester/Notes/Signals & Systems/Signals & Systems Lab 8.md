# Signals & Systems Lab 8

## Aim
To Learn The Z transform and use it in Matlab.

## What is Z transform
The Z-transform is a mathematical tool used in signal processing and control theory to analyze discrete-time signals and systems. It transforms a discrete-time signal, which is a sequence of real or complex numbers, into a complex frequency domain representation. The Z-transform of a discrete-time signal $x[n]$ is defined as:

$X(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n] z^{-n}$

where \( z \) is a complex number. This transformation is analogous to the Laplace transform for continuous-time signals. The Z-transform is particularly useful for solving difference equations and analyzing the stability and frequency response of discrete-time systems.
