# How to Use?
U can simply download it on .zip and try using it with visual studio code but genuinely from my experience obsidian is better and doesn't cost you much to try.
### The Better Way!
Follow the instructions below.

## Items Needed
- [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/download)
	- Because I made this on obsidian it should work the best on obsidian for you too.
- [Plugins](Readme.md#Plugins)
	- I am not using raw obsidian to display everything on the note files. Certain extensions are needed to view diagrams because I drew them in excalidraw.
- [Git](#Git)
	- If u dont know how to use git at this point of your academic then I suggest you learn it...

# Plugins
- [ExcaliDraw](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian-excalidraw-plugin)
	- This plugin is essential for diagrams and S&S Graphs

# Git
git cli is needed for seamless downloading of files without duplication and other mess.
If u don't have git cli installed simply do 
### For Windows
```cmd
winget install git
```
### For Bash
```bash
sudo apt install git
```
### For mac
First use this command
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
Then use this
```bash
`$ brew install git`
```
else u can simply follow [Mac Git Installation Guidei](https://git-scm.com/download/mac)
If you have anything else I am pretty sure you can find your way.


### I Have git now what?
#### For Viewers 
You need not learn every git command the only two u need are here.
##### Clone
This Command basically Clones the repository into wherever you are in cmd or bash.
```git
git clone https://github.com/TJ2005/BTech-Third-Semester.git 
```
After this a new directory called Btech-Third-Semester will be created wherever you are at CMD. After that u can simply open it in obsidian and Read it!
##### Pull
Once you have the Btech-Third-Semester folder you can simply Pull the new updates in the notes I made and all the new files will be downloaded. 
```git
git pull
```

#### For Contributors
- Learn Git
- Learn how to use obsidian ( its easy )
- I will be fixing a branch for public use shortly you can merge there.
