![[Pasted image 20241005035640.png]]# comms//
A platform where people can talk and share files and data without needing an account or any other thing of any sorts.
## What is Comms//
Comms aims to be a platform that people can communicate by simply connecting and sharing a common code via some other means.
Imagine a room where u need a key to enter. That key is also the address of the room.

## Why make this?
Because it doesn't exist. Sharing data to other users becomes very hectic for common users like students due to link bans and firewalls.

## Who does this target?
This targets the user base of mostly students and programmers.

# Page Progress
## State of page
- home page :white_check_mark: 
- Boot animation :white_check_mark: 
- Logo shift animation on the way
## Next tasks
- add good css to home page
- Completing logo shift animation
- completing submit button 

## Next Ideation Part
- What to do with chat servers?
- How to write it?
- Submit form
## Backend
- figure out how chat servers work
	- make an algorithm flow chart for that
- figure out how post and get requests work
- figure out a good database that'll run on the vps

## Pages
- Boot
- Home page
- Chat Page
- Configuration
- Further planned pages
	 - Login
	 - Google Pair

Realistically we have only 3 pages lmao

## Other ideas
### Problem case
Transferring chat session as the same user from one device to other
#### Solution Docking
- A button to unlock the username for docking
- Go to other device and login with same username and code
 - Server checks if session already exists 
 - if already exists it checks ifthe username is unlocked for docking or not
 - if unlocked transfer session
 - if not reject access
- session transfer complete

# Project Directing
